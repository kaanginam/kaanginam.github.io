I started my twitch channel many years back when I just wanted to play some games with my friends.
Those friends usually could not play the games I was playing themselves, so they were really excited always.
It was always fun and I enjoyed it a lot.

Some years pass and I did not stream for a while, then I started getting into Yu-Gi-Oh! and thought it would be fun to stream it, since I was inspired by some popular streamers. At the beginning not a lot happened, but after some time I was able to gather a small audience.
It was fun streaming with them, and some of them became friends of mine.

Nowadays, I still stream but mostly Master Duel. Sometimes I will do variety, depending on if I feel nostalgic.
