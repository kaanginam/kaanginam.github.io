Hi!

My name is Kaan, I am a 24 year old student. I am studying computer science, currently studying
for my Master degree in the University of Bonn. I was born in Oklahoma but I live in Germany! 

I currently work as a student worker in the University Clinic in Bonn. My main tasks include simple administration tasks, maintaining multiple web applications and setting up computers (hardware and software). 

Over the course of me studying, I have worked on some small projects just to educate myself. 
My proudest accomplishment was actually for my bachelor thesis which you can find [here](./_posts/2023-04-17-gnome-extmarkdown).

There is more I am working at, however it is not yet ready for release/launch. Here is a list of stuff I am working at:

- A Next.js application with a database to display a personal collection of Yu-Gi-Oh! cards
- Multiple python functions to help with Yu-Gi-Oh! decklists
- JSON to MySQL conversion 

Stuff I have experience in:
- Next.js/React.js
- Python
- JavaScript
- Open OnDemand
- GNOME Shell
- Streamlabs Chatbox editing
